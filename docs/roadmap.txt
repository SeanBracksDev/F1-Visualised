Getting Started
- Focus on the functionality:
    1. API calls for F1 data.
    2. Graphical representation of data (what libraries to use?)
    3. Dynamic data selection & representation - e.g selecting multiple drivers, laps etc


Future Improvements
- Web App Design
- Caching of data, instead of querying the API for the same thing multiple times
